Description: Working with the original 500 Cities Project data present a number of practical 
    challenges. Each release is nearly 228 megabytes in size (approaching half a gigabyte 
    for both together). The full releases contain data from multiple observational units as
    well as numerous variables that contain metadata that can be stored more efficiently in
    other formats. cityHealth provides "tidy" versions of the CDC's data in a format readily 
    accessible to R at a fraction of the footprint.
