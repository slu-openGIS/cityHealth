The goal of `cityHealth` is to provide easy access to the [CDC's 500 Cities Project](https://www.cdc.gov/500cities/). 

### Motivation
The original 2016 and 2017 data are in the public domain and easily downloaded from the CDC. Working with the raw data present a number of practical challenges. Each release is nearly 228 megabytes in size (approaching half a gigabyte for both together). The full releases contain data from multiple observational units, and also have a separate corresponding shapefile containing the tract boundaries from all 500 cities clipped to their city boundary.

`cityHealth` provides "tidy" versions of the CDC's data in a format readily accessible to `R` at a fraction of the footprint. One way this is acheived is by removing metadata from each observation that is more economically stored in an alternate format. Thus the tables available in `cityHealth` are not identical to the [raw data](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities/500-Cities-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-2017-relea/6vp6-wxuq) available from the CDC.
